Quick repo for ChatGPT python watch dial generating scripts

This came from an idea I had while bored one Sunday lunch time. 
"Lets see if we can get ChatGPT to code some python to generate an SVG suitable for use as a watch dial."

Chat log of the original attempt is here ->  https://chat.openai.com/share/d59f87c6-86aa-4a44-85eb-c801da463bf3
